            "reviews.text      (The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more  \\\n",

            "reviews.text      (The volume does not work with the iPhones. Please, if you have an iPhone, do your research before buying them, e.g. first line of product description. These work WELL for androids)br /br /I wanted to give these headphones a try, so I preordered them at the end of June. They finally came today and I got to try them out.br /br /FEEL: They feel like the Apple EarPods headphones when its in your ear. For me, it's very comfortable. I haven't had a chance to keep them in all day, but I've had them in for 30 minutes to an hour at a time.br /br /AUDIO: I'm not a complete audiophile, but I do like the occasional nice set of headphones. If you're thinking these are a nice set of headphones, then don't even think about ordering.br /I guess I would say they're pretty similar in sound to the EarPods, but I would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones. Hands down.br /One thing I did love about the EarPods, was that I could still hear everything around me while I had both headphones in. These are the same way. Some may not like it, but I think it's perfect for use around the house, at work, or even for working out. I like for the fact I can still hear things going around me. If the ambient noise is too loud, just turn up the volume.br /I do want to say, that so far, they seem to have good lows and mids. It's pretty crisp in sound. The bass isn't too bad either. It's not like a Skullcandy set of headphones, but the bass IS there (honestly better than I would have expected for these headphones)br /br /LOOKS: I love the black look. Tangle free cord is very nice to have, and I also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling.Read more  \\\n",

Should have been that way from day one.*end editLet's get the cost/benefit of buying this versus the 50 model out of the way. For 100, you get:7 Kindle Fire without sponsored lockscreens 65Kid-proof case 202-year accident protection 161-year of Free Time Unlimited 36 minimumThat's a nice value! I've seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi, but I'm not sure what their expectations are. If you have previously download an app/game/video and it doesn't require internet access (some do, some don't), it works fine. As for performance, it's OK. Not great. It freezes every now and then and needs to be rebooted more often than I'd like to get it working again. This is frustrating to a 3-year-old, as you can imagine. Hard to complain too much given the price, but I was expecting it to be more stable.You will want to buy a micro SD card because the Fire OS takes up 5 of the 8 GB of on-board storage. This is where Amazon is doing something that is, shall we say, a little sketchy. When you customize your purchase, it allows you to select the SanDisk 32 GB SD Memory Card for All-New Fire Tablets for 19.99 (or more or less depending on the storage size), but gives you no other options. This SD card is by the looks of it the exact same as this one ...Read more  \\\n",

            "reviews.text      1. While a great idea to make the cover self-standing, it's annoying that it's floppy when not in use.2. I bought the cover because my first Kindle didn't have a cover and often got left on, wearing down the battery. My second Kindle cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device. So I wanted that feature on my third Kindle. Even though I think it's over priced, I like the convenience.3. My other cover was black, which often got lost on dark surfaces. This time I got the denim blue, so it's much easier to find from a distance.  \\\n",

            "reviews.text      50 Despite the dirt cheap price, i find it to be great for casual use. Videos play nice, games even play nice, text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens. Watch the video for full demo!The short/summed up version: it's the new budget king in the 6-8 size. It's screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at, it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks, and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras, b/g/n wifi, and good overall battery life (minus an hour) My favorite size tablet is 8, so if you're looking at the amazon fire lineup, i would take this over the 6 for sure, and would have a hard time picking the 8 fire at 3x the price. If you're not a prime member, it's still a good tablet, if you are a prime member: it's a great tablet. Possible quality control issue: Mine had two dead pixels (not very noticeable, but still will exchange) You can load APKs(enable unknown sources), i loaded antutu and panasonic image app, both work properly.Just some background, i currently own 5 tablets not including this new one, ranging from a nook color, a samsung tab pro 8.4, LG g pad x8.3, an old acer a500 and an off brand 10.1. Suffice it to say: i know my tablets!Main Cons:-2 dead pixels-Front and rear cameras are low resolution, mostly good for video calls only-1 speaker, sounds tinny like a small laptop, Gets decently loud, use headphones!-Text not very crisp (but still decent to read)The rest are overall Positives:-7-8 is my favorite tablet size, 6 is just a bit too tiny, and 9+ can be cumbersome-Uses a slightly slower quad core 1.Read more  \\\n",

My two frustrations are you cannot change the wake up word \"Alexis\", and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service. If you are Amazon prime or Audible book member, it is a great addition to you household.  \\\n",

I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats  \\\n",
